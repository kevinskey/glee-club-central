# Recording Process Guide

This project includes a karaoke studio and recording tools built with open source audio libraries such as **Tone.js** and **WaveSurfer.js**. Recordings are stored in a Supabase Storage bucket named `audio`.

## Steps to record

1. Navigate to `Dashboard -> Recording Library`.
2. Select the **Karaoke Studio** tab.
3. Choose a backing track and click **Record**. A short countdown begins.
4. Sing along with the track. Use the volume sliders to balance vocals and backing.
5. When finished, press **Stop**. Review the preview and save your mix.
6. The audio file is uploaded to the `audio` bucket and listed under **My Karaoke Recordings**.

You can download or delete any saved mix from the recordings table.
